/*
In computer programming, a memory barrier, also known as a memory fence or memory synchronization barrier,
is a mechanism used to enforce ordering constraints on memory operations performed by multiple threads
or processors.It ensures that memory access operations(e.g., read and write) are properly synchronized 
and do not violate the intended order of execution.

In a multi - threaded environment, threads can access shared memory concurrently, which can lead to
various issues like data races, where multiple threads try to accessand modify shared data simultaneously.
Memory barriers help prevent these issues by establishing a clear order of execution for memory operations.

There are two main types of memory barriers :

Compiler Memory Barriers :
These barriers are specific to the compilerand ensure that the compiler does not reorder memory operations around the barrier.For example, the volatile keyword in C++ is often used to create a compiler memory barrier.
*/

volatile int complier_sharedVariable;

/* The 'volatile' keyword prevents compiler optimizations that could reorder reads / writes to sharedVariable
Hardware Memory Barriers :
These barriers involve CPU instructions that enforce ordering of memory operations at the hardware level.
They ensure that memory operations on one processor core become visible to other cores in the correct order
.Different processors have different instructions for memory barriers.For instance, 
on x86, the "MFENCE" instruction serves as a full memory barrier.

Here's a simple example to illustrate how a memory barrier can be used:
In this example, the writer thread stores a value into the sharedVariable using std::memory_order_relaxed,
which means the store operation itself is not synchronized. However, we enforce a memory barrier 
with std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_release) after the store operation to ensure that
all previous memory writes are visible to other threads.

Similarly, the reader thread uses std::atomic_thread_fence(std::memory_order_acquire) before loading
the value from sharedVariable, ensuring that the read operation is properly synchronized with any 
preceding memory operations.

Memory barriers play a crucial role in low-latency applications, where precise control over memory 
access and synchronization is necessary to minimize delays and avoid race conditions. However, it's 
essential to use them judiciously and understand the memory model and implications specific to your
platform and requirements.

//we use std::atomic_thread_fence to introduce memory barriers beforeand after
//reading the shared counter.The std::memory_order_acquire memory order is used 
//before the load operation to ensure that any memory writes performed by other 
//threads before this point are visible to the current thread.Similarly, 
//the std::memory_order_release memory order is used after the load operation to
//ensure that any memory writes performed by the current thread are visible to 
//other threads after this point.
//
//This use of memory barriers provides proper synchronizationand ensures that the
//final value read from the sharedCounter reflects the correct state after all the 
//threads have completed their work.
//
//Please note that the choice of memory orderingsand memory barriers should be made carefully
//based on the specific synchronization requirements of your program.In this example,
//we use std::memory_order_relaxed for the atomic operations as it provides minimal synchronization overhead.
//However, you might need different memory orderings for different use cases, depending on your specific
//thread synchronization needs.Always ensure that your thread - safe design meets the requirements of 
//your multi - threaded program and avoids potential data races or other synchronization issues.
